        <p> Okonomiyaki is a Japanese pancake, basically. Yum yum!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>100g plain flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>100ml cooled dashi stock</li>
            <li>1 baby potato, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>1/4 white, pointed sweetheart cabbage, shredded</li>
            <li>1 spring onion, finely slice</li>
            <li>thumb siced piece ginger, grated</li>
            <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp mirin</li>
            <li>100g lightly cooked squid, king prawns and octopus</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for cooking</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, egg and stock. Mix until smooth, whisking out any lumps without overmixing. Add the potato, season with a little salt and white pepper, cover and rest for at least 2 hrs.</li>
            <li>While the mix is resting, combine the ingredients for the sauce, stirring until it’s smooth. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove the batter from the fridge and add the cabbage, spring onion, ginger, soy, mirin and chosen seafood. Stir to thoroughly coat the mix in the batter.</li>
            <li>Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Pour the mixture into the pan, keeping it as circular as possible. Fry for 3-5 mins. Use a palette knife to help you flip it over and cook for a further 3-5 mins, using a lid at intervals to trap the heat so it cooks through. Test to see if it’s ready by sticking a chopstick into the middle. If it comes out dry, it’s ready.</li>
            <li>Flip onto a board and serve with the sauce and garnishes to taste. Eat straight away.</li>
        </ol>
